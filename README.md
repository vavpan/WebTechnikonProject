**FrontEnd repository -> https://github.com/vavpan/FrontendTechnikon**

**About the app**

This project is an access management system that provides two different roles, Admin and User, each with a different set of menu options and functionalities. The Admin role can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on PropertyOwners, Properties, and Repairs, and can also search for specific records using various fields, such as VAT or submission date. The Admin role also has access to additional menu options and pages that are not available to a simple User.

The User role, on the other hand, can view their profile and manage their personal information, as well as view the properties and repairs they are associated with. All changes made to PropertyOwners, Properties, and Repairs are stored in a database.
